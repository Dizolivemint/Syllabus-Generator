Welcome to the Syllabus Generator Project

To get started create a MySQL database called syllabusgen and import the .sql file included with these files. This will give you a basic database to work with. Then you may need to change some settings in the settings file, which is in the includes folder.

The Admin username and password to log into the system once you get it set up is admin/password.

The database included in the project has one term set up, two users and two courses.

Purpose:
This project is about generating syllabi for Art Institute. There are three levels of users: Instructors, Directors and Administrators.

Instructors will be able to add pieces of content to a syllabus for specific classes, picked from a list of courses.

Directors will be able to set up courses and enter information specific to each course.

Administrators will be able to set up marking terms and set general language that appears on all syllabi.

Ultimately, Instructors will send completed syllabi to Directors for final approval. Directors will approve syllabi and then Instructors will be able to generate a docx file from the system to add to their online course.
